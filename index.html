   <h2>Hi there!</h2>
   <h2>I'm a self-taught (and still self-learning!) web developer. I'm also interested in all things software, hardware, and technology!</h2>

   <h2><u>My Skills</u></h2>
   <h3>Design and Development</h3>
    <img src="assets/cat programming.jpg" alt="cat programming" width="250">
    <p>I have recently been learning to code and have dabbled in learning Java, Kotlin, Python, and Android software development. I am currently focusing my efforts on learning web design!</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Reading and Writing (sort of)</h3>
    <img src="assets/dory writing.jpg" alt="dory writing" width="250">
    <p>I read a <i>lot</i> and have started working on writing a novel that will probably (but also probably not) make it on <i>The New York Times</i> Best Seller list. My favorite book is probably <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> by George Orwell.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>Chess</h3>
   <img src="assets/ChessSet.jpg" alt="chess pieces" width="250">
   <p>I've recently started playing chess and have come to the awful realization that I'm awful at chess. <i>The Queen's Gambit</i>, anyone?</p>
